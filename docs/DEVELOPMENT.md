# Development

## Run locally

Because this is a static client prototype, use any local static server. Example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## PR1 validation checklist

1. Load the app in a desktop browser and confirm the map renders.
2. Load on iPhone/iPad Safari and confirm the map renders and remains usable in portrait mode.
3. Accept location permission and confirm the map centers on device location and shows the marker popup (`Current device position`).
4. Deny location permission and confirm default view remains usable with a clear status message.
5. Confirm panning/zooming works with mouse and touch.
6. Confirm layer switching works for Streets, Satellite, and Terrain via the visible Leaflet layer control.
7. Confirm browser console has no runtime errors during these flows.
